            <br>
            <p>
                In the spring of 2022, I worked with the software startup Sesto Labs as a UX research intern. 
                <br><br>
                My team worked on developing Props, a mobile app that would let workplace team members express appreciation by "giving props" to their coworkers. Employers could give props to their employees, peers could give props to each other, and it would be public to all team members through activity feeds and leaderboards.
                <br><br>
                The Props app works on a model of increasing employee satisfaction through public displays of recognition. <strong>In my research I sought to validate that model by studying the relationship between recognition, appreciation, and motivation in employees. </strong>

                        <p>The study was centered on qualitative interviews. 
                            The participant pool consisted of five participants, both male and female, ranging from 18-55 in age. All participants were employed in some form of a team structure. 
                            Some of the participants were in entry-level positions, and some were managers with direct reports. 
                            
                            <br><br>
                            Each interview was conducted in person and recorded digitally, then transcribed and coded by theme. The results were organized, key quotes were pulled out, and then findings and suggestions were compiled to report back to the team.
                        <br><br>
                            I would have liked to expand the participant pool, but I was constrained by both time and limited budget to recruit participants.

                                <strong>Props has clear potential to some user bases, but the value wasn't immediately apparent to others.</strong> Some participants showed reluctance to use an app for employee recognition or didn't believe that their workplace needed a system for employee recognition.
                            <br><br></li>
                            <li>
                                Many workplaces already have a system for managers recognizing employees, but no participant in the study spoke of a system for peers recognizing each other. When coworkers express their appreciation for each other, it's usually in a private, interpersonal context. This means that managers aren't aware when their direct reports are being effective and receiving positive feedback. <strong>This could be an area of opportunity for Props: encouraging coworkers to recognize each other through a more formal system, thereby providing managers with crucial productivity and teamwork data.</strong>
                            <br><br></li>
                            <li>
                                Several participants expressed a desire to make recognition more tangible. One participant suggested a "gift shop" feature where employees could exchange their props for prizes or money. <strong>In order for the recognition to feel meaningful, users need to know how it benefits them.</strong>
                            <br><br></li>
                            <li>
                                Some people find public recognition embarrassing. Adding a feature for sending props privately would help accommodate different preferences.

            <p>
                This study suggests that Props has great potential in filling the nice of peer-to-peer appreciation. It could also have great value to managers and HR teams in their employee review process, providing quantitative records of their employees' best moments.
           <br><br>
           Not every organization will benefit from an app like Props, but if it's designed to be fun, gamified, and rewarding to use, it can easily find an audience and could greatly impact employee motivation.
